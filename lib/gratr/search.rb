    # Options are mostly callbacks passed in as a hash. 
    # The following are valid, anything else is ignored
    # :enter_vertex  => Proc  Called upon entry of a vertex
    # :exit_vertex   => Proc  Called upon exit of a vertex
    # :root_vertex   => Proc  Called when a vertex the a root of a tree
    # :start_vertex  => Proc  Called for the first vertex of the search
    # :examine_edge  => Proc  Called when an edge is examined
    # :tree_edge     => Proc  Called when the edge is a member of the tree
    # :back_edge     => Proc  Called when the edge is a back edge
    # :forward_edge  => Proc  Called when the edge is a forward edge
    #
    # :start         => Vertex  Specifies the vertex to start search from
    #
    # If a &block is specified it defaults to :enter_vertex
    #
    # Returns the list of vertexes as reached by enter_vertex
    # This allows for calls like, g.bfs.each {|v| ...}
    #
    # Can also be called like bfs_examine_edge {|e| ... } or
    # dfs_back_edge {|e| ... } for any of the callbacks
    #
    # A full example usage is as follows:
    #
    #  ev = Proc.new {|x| puts "Enter Vertex #{x}"}
    #  xv = Proc.new {|x| puts "Exit Vertex #{x}"}
    #  sv = Proc.new {|x| puts "Start Vertex #{x}"}
    #  ee = Proc.new {|x| puts "Examine Edge #{x}"}
    #  te = Proc.new {|x| puts "Tree Edge #{x}"}
    #  be = Proc.new {|x| puts "Back Edge #{x}"}
    #  fe = Proc.new {|x| puts "Forward Edge #{x}"}
    #  Digraph[1,2,2,3,3,4].dfs({ 
    #        :enter_vertex => ev, 
    #        :exit_vertex  => xv,
    #        :start_vertex => sv,
    #        :examine_edge => ee,
    #        :tree_edge    => te,
    #        :back_edge    => be,
    #        :forward_edge => fe })
    # 
    # Which outputs:
    #
    # Start Vertex 1
    # Enter Vertex 1
    # Examine Edge (1=2)
    # Tree Edge (1=2)
    # Enter Vertex 2
    # Examine Edge (2=3)
    # Tree Edge (2=3)
    # Enter Vertex 3
    # Examine Edge (3=4)
    # Tree Edge (3=4)
    # Enter Vertex 4
    # Examine Edge (1=4)
    # Back Edge (1=4)
    # Exit Vertex 4
    # Exit Vertex 3

    # A* Heuristic best first search
    # 
    # start is the starting vertex for the search
    #
    # func is a Proc that when passed a vertex returns the heuristic 
    #   weight of sending the path through that node. It must always
    #   be equal to or less than the true cost
    # 
    # options are mostly callbacks passed in as a hash, the default block is 
    # :discover_vertex and weight is assumed to be the label for the Edge.
    # The following options are valid, anything else is ignored.
    #
    # * :weight => can be a Proc, or anything else is accessed using the [] for the
    #     the label or it defaults to using
    #     the value stored in the label for the Edge. If it is a Proc it will 
    #     pass the edge to the proc and use the resulting value.
    # * :discover_vertex => Proc invoked when a vertex is first discovered
    #   and is added to the open list.
    # * :examine_vertex  => Proc invoked when a vertex is popped from the
    #   queue (i.e., it has the lowest cost on the open list).
    # * :examine_edge    => Proc invoked on each out-edge of a vertex
    #   immediately after it is examined.
    # * :edge_relaxed    => Proc invoked on edge (u,v) if d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v].
    # * :edge_not_relaxed=> Proc invoked if the edge is not relaxed (see above).
    # * :black_target    => Proc invoked when a vertex that is on the closed 
    #     list is "rediscovered" via a more efficient path, and is re-added
    #     to the OPEN list.
    # * :finish_vertex    => Proc invoked on a vertex when it is added to the 
    #     closed list, which happens after all of its out edges have been
    #     examined. 
    #
    # Returns array of nodes in path, or calls block on all nodes, 
    # upon failure returns nil
    #
    # Can also be called like astar_examine_edge {|e| ... } or
    # astar_edge_relaxed {|e| ... } for any of the callbacks
    #
    # The criteria for expanding a vertex on the open list is that it has the
    # lowest f(v) = g(v) + h(v) value of all vertices on open.
    #
    # The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic. It is exponential 
    # in the worst case, but is polynomial when the heuristic function h
    # meets the following condition: |h(x) - h*(x)| < O(log h*(x)) where h*  
    # is the optimal heuristic, i.e. the exact cost to get from x to the goal.
